# ttc-aag-api
The Express API for the TTC Automated Avatar Generator

This app was developed by following the below tutorial, so that is the best place to look for an idea of how it works and how you may be able to start editing it.

The API is hosting on the Craig Walker Heroku account, contact Pat Armstrong or Will McLean for login details.

To run locally you must have Postgres installed on you machine.

You will need to create a database by following: https://www.taniarascia.com/node-express-postgresql-heroku/#set-up-postgresql-database
However you need to match the database config found in the inti.sql file in this repo not the database config from the tutorial
Then `npm start` in the terminal. That should allow you to then use the https://github.com/craig-walker/ttc-aag app locally and talk to a local database
